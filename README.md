# Churn_Analysis
Churn rate refers to the percentage of employees that leave the company within a specified time period. Some staff churning is inevitable, but a high rate of churn is costly. Recruitment and training costs money, and it would be some time before the company would start getting return on investment on the new hirees.
Therefore if a company has a high churn rate, it needs to acquire the reason for the same, so that it could change its policies or rules to better accumulate its employees, and ultimately bring down the churn rate.
In this project, we prepare a model to determine if an employee will leave the company based
on the historical date, and come up with an efficient model for the same.
